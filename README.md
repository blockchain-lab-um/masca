## [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blockchain-lab-um/masca.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockchain-lab-um/masca)

Masca enables everyone to build their **decentralized and self-sovereign identity by enhancing MetaMask with functionalities to manage DIDs, VCs, and VPs.** Any dApp can connect it to access identity data, and dApp developers can already start with the integration!

# Features

Masca is built agnostic, leaving the user to choose his preferred **blockchain, DID method, and data storage provider.** Everything is configurable, just like selecting the network in MetaMask. Currently supported technologies:

- **Blockchains:** Any EVM-based blockchain that is supported by DID methods
- **DID methods:** `did:ethr`, `did:key`, `did:pkh`, `did:jwk`
- **Data storage providers:** Local MetaMask Snap state, Ceramic Network

Many new features are already in the works. For more information, please check the [roadmap](https://blockchain-lab-um.github.io/masca-docs/docs/roadmap) on the documentation.

# Development

### Versions

Every version of Masca does NOT work with every version of MetaMask Flask! Here is a table of compatible versions:

| Masca version | MetaMask Flask version |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1.2.2         | up to 10.19.0          |
| 1.3.0         | 10.24.0                |
| 1.4.0         | 10.25.0                |
| 1.5.0         | 10.26.1                |

### Prerequisites

- [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/)
  - ⚠️ You cannot have other versions of MetaMask installed
- Node.js `18`. We **strongly** recommend you install via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to avoid incompatibility issues between different node projects.
  - Once installed, you should also install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) with `npm i -g pnpm` to make working with this repository easiest.

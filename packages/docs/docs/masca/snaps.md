# About MetaMask Snaps

The most popular web3 crypto wallet, **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**, introduced **[Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/)**, which introduced building and adding new functionalities to the MetaMask wallet in the form of extensions. MetaMask is a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, providing a simple interface for users to interact with EVM-based blockchains, sign and send transactions, etc. Snaps thus make a wide specter of new applications possible. They can enable support for previously unsupported chains like Polkadot, Solana, Bitcoin, etc. They also provide additional local storage for dapps to store and retrieve data and allow access to the web with the possibility to leverage practically any API and much more. The creativity of developers only limits new functionality. Here is a [list of other Snaps](https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/awesome-metamask-snaps)!

Technically speaking, MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to expand the capabilities of MetaMask safely. A Snap - a JavaScript program - runs in an isolated, sandboxed environment inside the MetaMask. In addition to the existing MetaMask RPC methods, Snaps can create new RPC methods for websites to call. Currently, this is the only way to interact with the Snaps, but it will be possible to enhance the MetaMask's UI in the future with modified components.

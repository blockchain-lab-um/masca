# Use Cases

All this sounds great, but what are the actual use cases of **decentralized identity** and **SSI** in **web3** and other applications?

- Rich identity profiles of users without being vendor locked
- Privacy and sovereignty of data
- Protection against Sybil attacks
- Receive and present identity data without paying expensive gas fees (SSI works off-chain)
- Provide access to hidden resources within the community to members with certain VCs
- New ways of DAO governance based on earned achievements and skills
- Faster and reusable identification (KYC)
- Every other use case you come up with ... :)

In this place, we would like to mention many exciting projects already using DIDs and VCs in very cool ways:

- [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/),
- [Disco](https://www.disco.xyz/),
- [Orange Protocol](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/).

Check out their websites to see what they are up to!

# Use Cases

All this sounds great, but what are the actual use cases of **decentralized identity** and **SSI** in **web3** and **dApps**?

- Rich identity profiles of users
- Protection against Sybil attacks
- Receive and present identity data without paying expensise gas fees (SSI works off-chain)
- Provide access to hidden resources within the community to members with certain VCs
- New ways of DAO governance based on earned achievements and skills
- Every other use case you come up with ... :)

In this place, we would like to mention many exciting projects already using DIDs and VCs in very cool ways. [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/), [Disco](https://www.disco.xyz/), [Orange Protocol](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/), and others are some of these projects. You should check out their website to see what they are doing!

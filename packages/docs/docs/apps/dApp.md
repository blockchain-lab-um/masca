# SSI Snap App

**[SSI Snap App](https://blockchain-lab-um.github.io/ssi-snap)** is the official app for interacting with SSI Snap.

App allows users to:

- View all of their VCs,
- Create a custom VP using one or more credentials,
- Import a credential,
- Change did:method,
- Configure SSI Snap Settings,
- And much more to come...

SSI Snap App is certainly not the only way of interacting with SSI Snap. SSI Snap can be implemented into any dApp, the same way as MetaMask!

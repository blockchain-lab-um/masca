# Masca dApp

**[Masca dApp](https://masca.io)** is the official app for interacting with Masca and configuring it.

Users can use the official app to:

- view and manage all of their VCs,
- create a custom VP using one or more credentials,
- import a credential,
- change DID method,
- configure Masca,
- and many other things that will come...

Masca dApp is certainly not the only way of interacting with Masca. Any dApp can connect to Masca similarly to the MetaMask!

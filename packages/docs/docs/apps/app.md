# SSI Snap App

**[SSI Snap App](https://blockchain-lab-um.github.io/ssi-snap)** is the official app for interacting with SSI Snap and configuring it.

Users can use the official app to:

- view all of their VCs,
- create a custom VP using one or more credentials,
- import a credential,
- change DID method,
- configure SSI Snap,
- and many other things that will come...

SSI Snap App is certainly not the only way of interacting with SSI Snap. Any dApp can connect to SSI Snap similarly to the MetaMask!

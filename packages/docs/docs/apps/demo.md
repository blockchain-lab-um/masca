# Course Demo

To showcase the workflow of Masca, we have developed a demo platform.

In this demo, a user will install and approve Masca, get and store a VC after completing a straightforward course and display the VC on the profile page. Users can also enter a secret room by submitting their VP, but you must find the room first. :)

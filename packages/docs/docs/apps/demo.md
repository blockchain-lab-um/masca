# Course Demo

To showcase the workflow of the SSI Snap, we have developed a demo platform.

In this demo, a user will install and approve the SSI Snap, add a delegate to the DID Document of the selected MetaMask account, get and store a VC after completing a straight forward course and display the VC on the profile page. Users can also enter a secret room by submitting their VP, but you'll have to find the room first. :)

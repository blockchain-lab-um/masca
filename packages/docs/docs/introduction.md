# Introduction

Welcome web3 explorers! Did you ever feel that your **Decentralized Application (dApp)** is missing something, like better knowledge of your users and a more robust identity layer? Now you can integrate the powerful world of **Decentralized Identity/Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**, and **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** with just a few steps. No need for additional platforms and wallets; only one of the most popular **web3** wallets is required - MetaMask.

Masca is a **MetaMask Snap** (extension) that adds support for **SSI**: it can manage **DIDs**, store **VCs**, and create the **VPs**. These docs are a great place to learn about the SSI and find all the necessary information to start using it immediately!

Why use Masca?

- Give access to Decentralized Identity and SSI to millions of existing MetaMask and dApp users.
- Let MetaMask handle the security of cryptographic keys. You can also easily back them up with a seed phrase.
- Users can (and should) decide which DID method to use and where they want their VCs to be stored.
- You can easily integrate DIDs and VCs into your dApp using **[Masca Connector](./libraries/masca-connector)** library. No need to implement the logic for multiple DID methods and places to store VCs.
- dApps can quickly request VC (or create VP) with a single RPC call â€” no need to develop extra logic and care about where the VC is stored.

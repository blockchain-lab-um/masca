# Introduction

Welcome blockchain explorers! If you ever wanted to integrate the powerful world of **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**, and **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** into **decentralized applications (dApps)**, you have found the right place. No need for additional platforms and wallets, only one of the most popular **web3** wallets is required - MetaMask.

The SSI Snap is a **MetaMask Snap** (plugin) that can handle **DIDs**, securely store **VCs**, and create the **VPs**. These docs offer all the necessary information to start using it right away!

What are the use cases for **SSI** in **dApps**?

- Enriched identity profiles
- Credentials to access hidden resources
- DAO governance based on earned achievements and skills
- No gas identity data (everything is off-chain)
- Everything you come up with ... :)
